SPT indices emerging from translation invariance in two-dimensional quantum spin systems


In 2011, Chen, Liu and Wen introduced the notion of symmetry-protected topological phases of matter (SPT) In (Chen 2013), they used a setup involving so-called nonlinear sigma models and provided an $H^{d+1}(G,U(1))$ valued index for any $d$-dimensional nonlinear sigma model. Quantum spin systems are one other possible setup in which one can define SPT phases (defined in section 

In order to define SPT phases in this setting, one needs to fix a finite group $G$ with an on-site group action $g\mapsto U_g$ (with $g\in G$), defining a global group action $\beta_g$ (also defined in section \ref{sec:QuasiLocalC*Algebra}). A state omega is G-invariant if â€¦..

Subsequently, one needs to impose a restriction on the space of states. We ask that our states are short-range entangled (SRE), see definition \ref{def:sre}. A state $\omega$ is short range entangled if there is a disentangler $\gamma$. This is a locally generated automorphism produced by a one-parameter family of interactions $\Phi\in\BB_{F_\phi}([0,1])$ ($\gamma=\gamma_{0;1}^\Phi$ as defined in section \ref{sec:Interactions}) satisfying that $\omega\circ\gamma$ is a product state.
